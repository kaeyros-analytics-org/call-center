My problem is about getting a loan, I deposited requirements yesterday at Afriland Ipodrom in Yaoundé. 
They told me they have scanned them to your agency at daker since that’s where my branch is and that I will come and sign when you are done studying it, after which they will still scan and send to you and it’s take a duration of about 48hrs .
My problem is that I don’t reside in Yaoundé town and it’s requires me traveling from nanga eboko to yde which is an inconvenience for me
